# 12740-Ridecomfort-Pittsburgh
Ride comfort of different modes of transportation in Pittsburgh

# Introduction and Motivation
Depending on how close you live to CMU, getting to campus can take many forms. Regardless of which mode of transport is used, each has its benefits. Taking a car might save time, taking a bus might save money, and riding a bike or scooter might be the most practical. While these measures can be quantified based on time, cost, or both, one of the most critical aspects of these rides cannot be easily quantified: comfort. Attempting to measure the comfort of each of these rides is crucial in ultimately understanding the full range of benefits and disadvantages of each most of transportation. This analysis will use quantitative data to evaluate the comfort of each mode of public or private transport to campus.

# Goals
We will quantify the comfort of a ride based on three primary factors:
  1. Vibrations within the vehicle
  2. Sound volumes throughout the ride
  3. Temperature and humidity of the vehicle

Using sensors to sample the vibrations, sounds, temperature, and humidity in a setting, we will ultimately compare the obtained values for each of three modes of transportation (bus, car, and scooter/bike) and determine the comfort levels of each mode of transport.
